Exercise 5.15 (Movie Database)
The program should:

Simulate a database of movies and series with the ability to add, search, delete, and filter movies and series.
It should start with the following movies and series in a dictionary:
base = {
"movies" : ["Spider-Man", "The Avengers", "The Avengers 2"],
"series" : ["Prison Break", "Money Heist", "The Simpsons"]
}
Have 5 functions available in the menu:
Show the list of available movies or series vertically on the screen.
Add new movies or series (that are not already in the database).
Remove movies or series from the database.
Show, as required by the user, the list of movies from one point to another (e.g., the user wants to see from the 2nd to the 4th in a list).
Search for movies or series containing a word requested by the user. (e.g., input("el"), list the movies containing the word "el").
