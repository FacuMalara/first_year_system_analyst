Create a Movie class:

Whose constructor must initialize the attributes name, year, genre, nationality, and score
4 methods must be created in the class:

1. Present the movie: The movie {name} of {genre} from {year} obtained a score of {score} and was filmed in {nationality}
2. Return whether the movie's year is greater than, equal to, or less than the one passed as a parameter
3. Change the genre of a movie
4. Modify the movie's score (between 1 and 10)'''
