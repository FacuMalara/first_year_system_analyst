Introduction:
    The following program consists of software that simulates a personal agenda.
    The program should allow adding and removing Events from the system, as well 
    as managing event data (Date, Time, Location).

Requirements:
The program must:
*   Have an Event Class with attributes (event_name (unique), date, time, location)
*   Have two Child Classes that use the constructor of the parent class but have one 
    more attribute:
        - PersonalEvent (Attribute: organizer (name of the group organizing))
        - WorkEvent (Attribute: mandatory "True or False" (default = True))
        
*   Four methods must be created for the parent Event class (which will inherit the 
    child classes):
        1. Show information: Which indicates the event_name, date, and location of 
            the event 
        2. Get event type (type of inherited or parent classes)
        3. Set date and time (Set the Date and Time in a single function)
        4. Set location (Set the location)
